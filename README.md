Note: Omar's goals and contribution is to train 3 scikit identifies with normalization
      Hamza's contribution and goal is to train 3 scikit identifies without normalization
      
     
********************************PROJECT REPORT:********************************

-How you approached the task?

Our group divided the task of using 6 scikit multiclass identifiers into 2 group. One will perform nomalized and other will do it with non nomalized test data.The task was achieved my first splitting the data into 20% 80%. Then normalization was performed then multiclass scikit idenfiers were put in to train the data and get score or predictions

-Which models you selected and why?

As for now i used KNN and naive bayes models of scikit as both as efficient for good accuracy

-What were the performances of each model on local test data?


-Problems you faced?


Problems faced were the apply model on normalized data as data was split and exucution would go on forever. Then code was done in pieces bit by bit

-References you used?

I have used youtube and stackover flow for exceptions searching and overcoming problems

-Screenshots?


All attached of my part. (Omar)

Result: Uptil now the naive bayes normalized has the best accuracy result
